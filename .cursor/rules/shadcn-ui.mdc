# shadcn/ui Component Library

This project uses **shadcn/ui** for all UI elements. shadcn/ui is a collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Initialization

If shadcn/ui is not initialized in the project, use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

This will:
- Set up the necessary configuration files
- Configure Tailwind CSS
- Set up the components directory structure
- Install required dependencies

## Installing Components

If a particular component is not installed, use the following command to add it:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

For example, to install the button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Usage Guidelines

- Always use shadcn/ui components for UI elements instead of creating custom components from scratch
- Components are installed in the `components/ui` directory
- Import components from `@/components/ui/<component-name>`
- Components can be customized by editing the component files directly
- Check the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com) for available components and their usage
